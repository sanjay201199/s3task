      <h2>IAM service</h2>
      <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.</p>
      <p>When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.</p>
    <h3>IAM features</h3>
    <h3>IAM gives you the following features:</h3>
    
    <h3>Shared access to your AWS account</h3>
    <p>You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.</p>
    
    <h3>Granular permissions</h3>
    <p>You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources. For example, you might allow some users complete access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, and other AWS services. For other users, you can allow read-only access to just some S3 buckets, or permission to administer just some EC2 instances, or to access your billing information but nothing else.</p>
    
    <h3>Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2</h3>
    <p>You can use IAM features to securely provide credentials for applications that run on EC2 instances. These credentials provide permissions for your application to access other AWS resources. Examples include S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables.</p>
    
    <h3>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h3>
    <p>You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security. With MFA you or your users must provide not only a password or access key to work with your account, but also a code from a specially configured device.</p>
